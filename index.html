  <p>STEP 7: This will name the URL path the same as the name of your repository. You'll see a message at the top of the screen that says 
  your site is ready to be published at this URL. To hasten the process, type that URL into the 'Custom domain' input field and click 'Save'</p>

  <p>STEP 8: You will now see a message if you scroll back down to 'GitHub Pages' that your site is now published!</p>

  <p>STEP 9: Go to the URL your site is published at and you will see your project live.</p>
